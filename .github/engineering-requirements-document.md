# Engineering Requirements Document: Automated Invoice Processing Application for Swipe

This document outlines the engineering requirements for the automated invoice processing application for Swipe, as described in the provided PRD and technical documentation.

## 1. System Overview

This application aims to automate the extraction, processing, and management of invoice data from various file formats (Excel, PDF, images) using AI-powered extraction. The extracted data will be organized into Invoices, Products, and Customers sections within a React application, with real-time synchronization using Zustand.

### Major Components and Interactions

- **File Upload Component:** Handles user file uploads (Excel, PDF, image).
- **Data Extraction Service:** Utilizes the Google Gemini API for extracting data from uploaded files.
- **Data Processing Layer:** Manages data transformation, validation, and synchronization using Zustand. May include a backend (tRPC) for complex operations or persistent storage.
- **Data Presentation Components:** React components for displaying Invoices, Products, and Customers data in tabular format, enabling editing and real-time updates.
- **Database (Optional):** For persistent data storage (e.g., Prisma with a PostgreSQL database).
- **File Storage:** Temporary storage for uploaded files before and after processing (potentially using the Gemini File API's temporary storage).

### Technical Constraints and Limitations

- **File Size Limits:** Dependent on the Gemini API and chosen file storage solution.
- **Gemini API Rate Limits:** Need to handle API limits and implement retry mechanisms.
- **Supported File Formats:** Currently limited to Excel, PDF, and common image formats.
- **Browser Compatibility:** Ensure compatibility with target browsers.
- **Offline Functionality:** Not supported in the initial scope.

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Zustand, Tailwind CSS, tRPC (optional)
- **Backend (Optional):** Node.js, tRPC, Prisma, PostgreSQL
- **AI/Data Extraction:** Google Gemini API
- **File Storage:** Gemini File API or cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)

## 2. Functional Requirements Breakdown

### File Upload

- **Endpoint:** `/api/upload` (if using tRPC) or handled directly in the frontend.
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Request Format:** `multipart/form-data`
- **Response Format:** JSON containing file URI, status, and any error messages.
- **Input Validation:** File type, size.
- **Error Handling:** Display user-friendly error messages for invalid files or upload failures.

### Data Extraction

- **Gemini API Integration:** Use the Document and Vision APIs as appropriate.
- **Data Mapping:** Define clear mapping between extracted data and application data models.
- **Error Handling:** Handle API errors, potentially retrying requests or prompting user intervention.

### Invoices Tab

- **Data Display:** Table with Serial Number, Customer Name, Product Name, Quantity, Tax, Total Amount, and Date.
- **Data Editing:** Inline editing enabled for all fields (with appropriate validations).
- **Data Synchronization:** Real-time updates via Zustand.

### Products Tab

- **Data Display:** Table with Name, Quantity, Unit Price, Tax, Price with Tax, and optional Discount.
- **Data Editing:** Inline editing with validation for numeric fields.
- **Data Synchronization:** Real-time updates via Zustand.

### Customers Tab

- **Data Display:** Table with Customer Name, Phone Number, and Total Purchase Amount. Additional fields can be added.

## 8. Technical Constraints & Assumptions

- Reliance on external APIs (Gemini).
- Assumption of reliable internet connectivity.

## 9. Timeline & Milestones

- **Phase 1 (Week 1):** Project setup, basic UI, file upload, initial Gemini API integration.
- **Phase 2 (Week 2):** Data extraction refinement, data processing and validation, Zustand integration.
- **Phase 3 (Week 3):** Invoices, Products, and Customers tabs implementation, real-time updates.
- **Phase 4 (Week 4):** Testing, bug fixes, deployment.

**(Detailed breakdown of requirements, acceptance criteria, dependencies, priority, estimated effort, and technical risks will be added as the project progresses and more specific information becomes available.)**

This document provides a comprehensive starting point for the engineering team. Further details and refinements will be added during the project lifecycle.
